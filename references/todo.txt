Pointer vs reference

Explain in detail the differences between the pointers (that must
always exist, because we can change them at run time), and references
(that exist only at compile time, because they do not need to exist at
run time, as they cannot be changed).  In the place of a reference,
the compiler hardcodes the address of the data the reference is bound
to.
