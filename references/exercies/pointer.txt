Goal: find out whether references are always optimized out.

Compile (without linking) the pointer.cpp program into the assembly:

g++ -c -S pointer.cpp

Take a look at the assembly of the main function.  When passing by
reference to function foo, are we not just passing a pointer?

Now, define a body of the function (up to now the function was only
declared), and compile again.  Was the reference optimized out?
