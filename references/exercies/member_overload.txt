Please implement struct `A` that has:

* a member field `m_txt` of type `string` and a constructor that
  initializes that field using a const reference to an object (of type
  `string`) passed to the constructor,

* the prefix increment operator implemented as two member function
  overloads:

  1. the first overload is called for an object of an lvalue, the
     overload returns the object by lvalue reference, and appends
     `"l"` to `m_txt`,

  2. the second overload is called for an object of an rvalue, the
     overload returns the object by rvalue reference, and appends
     `"r"` to `m_txt`.
