Please implement function `singleton` that returns a `shared_ptr` to a
default-constructed object of class `A`.  The function should track a
previously created object, but should not own it.  If that object
still exists in subsequent calls, the function should return a
`shared_ptr` to that previously-created object.  Otherwise, the
function should create a new one.
