Write a header file "name.hpp" that implements a struct template
"name" that is parametrized with the type that can store names, e.g.,
const char *, std::string.  This type should have just a member field,
so that we can initialize an object of this type with {}.  Please make
sure your implementation compiles with a sample program name.cc.

Define a non-member function get_name that takes an object of the
"name" struct, and returns by reference the value that described the
name.  There have to be two functions:

* one that takes a non-const reference to name<T>, and returns a
  non-const reference to the member field,

* one that takes a const reference to name<T>, and returns a non-const
  reference to the member field.

Also, overload the << operator for the output stream, so that we can
print the value of the object to std::cout.
