Implement a struct `heir` that inherits from any number of base
classes.  Its constructor should accept as many arguments as there are
base classes.  The parameters of the constructor should be of a const
reference to respective base types and should be used to initialize
the respective base objects: the i-th parameter is of a const
reference to the i-th base class and is passed to initialize its base
object.

Take a look at heir.cc how we want to use that struct.
