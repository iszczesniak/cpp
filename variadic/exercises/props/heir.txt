Implement a struct "heir" that inherits from any number of base
classes.  Its constructor should take by a const reference one
argument to pass to each base contructor.  Implement with a fold
expression the << operator that would call the << operator for the
base classes.

Take a look at heir.cc how we want to use that struct.
