Implement function my_make_unique that accepts one argument and
creates on the heap an object of type A with the perfectly forwarded
argument.  Next, the function passes the created object to an object
of class unique_ptr<A> for management and then returns by value the
managing object.  Please overload the constructors of A, and make sure
the right constructor is called.
