Please implement a benchmark that would measure the performance of
programs of exercises power1.txt and power2.txt in two different
implementations:

* recursive, as described in the exercises,

* iterative, i.e., with a regular loop.

Compile the benchmark with different optimization options -O0 and -O3.

Take a look at the assembly output (-S) for the powers of 0, 1 and 2.
Can you see the loop?
