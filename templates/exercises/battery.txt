Implement a function called "battery".  The function should take three
arguments:

* a value of any type T, T is a template parameter

* a container of any type, provided it stores elements of type T,

* a callable of any type, provided it takes two arguments of type T.

The battery function should iterate over the elements of the
container, and call the callable for the element and value passed to
the function as the first argument.  The result of the callable should
be sent to cout.
