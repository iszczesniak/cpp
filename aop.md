# Advanced object programming

* [Memory organization](memory)
* [Expression categories](categories)
* [References](references)
* [Move semantics](move)
* [Callable](callable1)
* [Containers](containers)
* [`std::unique_ptr`](unique_ptr)
* [`std::shared_ptr`](shared_ptr)
* [`std::weak_ptr`](weak_ptr)

# Rules

You can get a grade from the laboratory class within two deadlines:

* Deadline I: by the end of laboratory classes based on four tests
  during lectures:

  - November 7, 2025 (cpp/memory, cpp/categories, cpp/references),

  - December 19, 2025 (cpp/move, cpp/callable1, cpp/containers),

  - January 23, 2026 (cpp/unique_ptr, cpp/shared_ptr, cpp/weak_ptr),

  - January 30, 2026 (the whole material).

  The grade withing the first deadline is an average of three highest,
  **passing** grades chosen from among the four test grades.  If you
  don't manage to get three positive test grades, then you fail (get
  the 2.0 grade) within the first deadline.

  If you miss a test, you get a failing grade from that test.  A test
  cannot be retaken.  The last test is chance to get an extra grade.

* Deadline II: based on a test during the time for the first exam.

You can take an exam twice during the exam session, provided you have
a positive grade from the laboratory class.  The exam is written, like
an essay.

Exam deadlines:

* Deadline I: to be established,

* Deadline II: to be established.

You can get the final grade within two deadlines.  The final grade is
an average of the **positive** grades from the laboratory and the
exam.  If we haven't got a lab class grade or we haven't passed an
exam, the final grade is the failing grade.
