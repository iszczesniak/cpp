Write a function that calculates (using int) the factorial for a
number given as the template argument, so that I can call:

factorial<5>();

Implement the function as recursive, and break the recursion with
template specialization.

Please note that a function specialization cannot be partial, and so
we have to define it for a specific type, e.g., int.  Using the
compile-time conditional statement (`if constexpr`) is better, because
it does not require a specialization.
