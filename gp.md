# Rules

You get three grades:

* a grade from the laboratory class,

* a grade from the exam,

* a final grade.

## Laboratory grade

A laboratory class grade is from your programming skills.  You can get
your grade within two deadlines:

* Deadline I: by the end of laboratory classes based on four tests
  during lectures.  The material tested and the dates:

  - part 1: November 7, 2025,

  - part 2: December 19, 2025,

  - part 3: January 23, 2026,
  
  - all parts: January 30, 2026.

  The grade withing the first deadline is an average of three highest,
  **passing** test grades chosen from among the four test grades.  If
  you don't manage to get three passing test grades, then you get a
  failing grade (2.0) within the first deadline.

  If you miss a test, you get a failing grade from that test.  A test
  cannot be retaken.  The last test (that covers all parts) is a
  chance to get an extra grade.

* Deadline II: based on a test (that covers all parts) during the time
  for the first exam.

## Exam grade

You can take an exam twice during the exam session, provided you have
a passing grade from the laboratory class.  The exam is written, like
an essay.

Exam deadlines:

* Deadline I: to be established,

* Deadline II: to be established.

## Final grade

You can get the final grade within two deadlines.  The final grade is
an average of the **positive** grades from the laboratory class and
the exam.  If you haven't got a lab class grade or haven't passed an
exam, the final grade is the failing grade.
