# Rules

You get three grades:

* a grade from the laboratory class,

* a grade from the exam,

* a final grade.

## Laboratory grade

You can get a grade from the laboratory class within two deadlines:

* Deadline I: by the end of laboratory classes based on four tests
  during lectures:

  - November 7, 2025 (generic, template, variadic),

  - December 19, 2025 (deduction, specialization, auto),

  - January 23, 2026 (forwarding, callable2, constraints, concepts),

  - January 30, 2026 (the whole material).

  The grade withing the first deadline is an average of three highest,
  **passing** test grades chosen from among the four test grades.  If
  you don't manage to get three passing test grades, then you a
  failing grade (2.0) within the first deadline.

  If you miss a test, you get a failing grade from that test.  A test
  cannot be retaken.  The last test is a chance to get an extra grade.

* Deadline II: based on a test during the time for the first exam.

## Exam grade

You can take an exam twice during the exam session, provided you have
a passing grade from the laboratory class.  The exam is written, like
an essay.

Exam deadlines:

* Deadline I: to be established,

* Deadline II: to be established.

## Final grade

You can get the final grade within two deadlines.  The final grade is
an average of the **positive** grades from the laboratory class and
the exam.  If you haven't got a lab class grade or haven't passed an
exam, the final grade is the failing grade.
