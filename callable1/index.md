title: Callable, sth to call
---

# Introduction

In C we use a function pointer to ship a piece of code (e.g., that
establishes ordering between objects) to some other piece of code
(e.g., a sorting function).  In C++ a generalization of a function is
something that we can call.  We call it a **callable**.  Calling a
callable has the syntax of calling a function (i.e., applying the `()`
operator), and the function interface: we know the types of the
parameters and the return value.

The goal of that generalization is to:

* avoid calling a function indirectly, i.e., using a pointer, so that
  a function being called can be inlined (i.e., compiled into the
  place of call),

* allow for keeping some extra (which are not passed as call
  arguments) data, which we cannot do with a function pointer.

The standard library is using (passing, keeping as a member field)
callables **by value** (i.e., not by reference), so **copying a
callable should be fast**.  Callables passed to standard algorithms
(e.g., `std::sort`) and standard containers (e.g.,
`std::priority_queue`) should be copied fast.  That means, a callable
should not keep a lot of data that would be copied.

Callable is frequently used by value (e.g., by the standard library),
but it can be used by reference or by pointer too.

## Motivation

We sort integers below.  We can do it, because integers have a
built-in operator `<` defined:

```cpp
{% include_relative motivation1.cc %}
```

Below we sort data of a user-defined type, and to this end we need to
define the ordering (we could also say to establish ordering) between
the objects with the **comparison operator**, i.e., **the `<`
operator**.  There are a number of comparison operators that we can
define for a user-defined type: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `=>`,
`<=>`, but for the ordering between elements (the objects of the
user-defined type), the most important operator is the **less-than
operator**, i.e., the `<` operator.  We could refer to the less-than
operator as *the comparison operator*, but to avoid confusion, we
refer to it as the `<` operator.

We defined the `<` operator as a member function: `this` is the first
object to compare, and the function parameter is the second.  The
member comparison operator should be declared as `const` (because it
should not modify its object, i.e., `this`), and it should take the
other operand by a const reference (because it should not change that
operand).

```cpp
{% include_relative motivation2.cc %}
```

Function `std::sort` is using the `<` operator by default, i.e., if we
do not provide a comparison callable as the last call argument.  Well,
by default, `std::sort` is actually using an object of type
`std::less` which in turn uses the `<` operator.  For comparing the
sorted elements, the implementation of `std::sort` does not use the
`<` directly, because it would be stuck with it, and be unfit for
customization.  Instead, the implementation uses a callable for
comparison.

No wonder that we can get the same effect as in the example above if
we pass as the last argument an object of type `std::less<A>` (that's
a callable), because if we didn't, it would be used anyway:

```cpp
{% include_relative motivation3.cc %}
```

With `std::sort`, we do not always have to use the `<` operator, and
instead we can pass a callable to establish ordering.  We can sort in
ascending order if we pass an object of the `std::greater` type.  That
type is using the `>` operator, and so we have to define it instead of
the `<` operator.

```cpp
{% include_relative motivation4.cc %}
```

A callable can be passed not only to a function, but also to a
constructor, which can store the callable as a member field, as, e.g.,
the standard priority queue (type `std::priority_queue`) does.  Here's
an example, which we'll be modifying later:

```cpp
{% include_relative pq.cc %}
```

# Callable types

A callable is either:

* a function (used by pointer or reference),

* a functor (used by value, reference or pointer).

## A function

An expression that is only the name of a function, e.g., `foo`,
(without the `()` operator) can be treated as the address of that
function, which is called the decay of a function to a pointer.  We
can also take the address of a function by preceeding the name of the
function with the `&` operator, e.g., `&foo`.  These ways of taking a
function address are equivalent, which is inconsistent, because there
should be just one way.

Having this address, we can call the function.  The only operations we
can do with a function pointer is: take a function address, call the
function.

In the example below we use a function by pointer and by reference.

```cpp
{% include_relative function.cc %}
```

Here we sort descendingly by passing a function pointer:

```cpp
{% include_relative sort_foo.cc %}
```

By default, the priority queue sorts descendlingly, i.e., the returns
the largest elemenets.  In the example below, we pass a pointer to a
comparison function, so that the queue sorts ascendingly.

```cpp
{% include_relative pq_foo.cc %}
```

## A functor

A functor is an object on which we can call the `()` operator.  The
exact definition of the `()` operator depends on how we call a
functor.  In comparison with a function, a functor is more capable,
because it can keep some extra data passed to its constructor.

In the example below we define a simple functor type, create a
functor, and call it.  The functor is a callable, because we can call
it.  Since the `()` operator was defined constant, we can call it for
constant functors.

```cpp
{% include_relative functor1.cc %}
```

We can store some data in a functor:

```cpp
{% include_relative functor2.cc %}
```

A functor acts just like a function when it keeps no data.  For
example, types `std::less` and `std::greater` act like functions,
because they do not store any data.  Such functor types introduce no
performance hit: the constructors and destructors are empty, so they
generate no code, and the comparison function is inlined.  It's as
fast as it can be.

By default, the priority queue uses `std::less`, and returns the
largest element.  To make the priority queue return the smallest
element, we can pass it a functor of type `std::greater`:

```cpp
{% include_relative pq_ro.cc %}
```

Here we define a functor type, which acts like a function:

```cpp
{% include_relative pq_fo1.cc %}
```

In the example below we pass to a functor a boolean value that is used
by the call operator.  This value is passed at run-time.  This
functionality couldn't be achieved with a function.

```cpp
{% include_relative pq_fo2.cc %}
```

# Closure

A **closure** is a functor which is the result of a **lambda
expression**.  A lambda (in short for a lambda expression) is
*syntactic sugar* for conveniently creating functors: they help us
create functors with less fuss in comparison with creating a functor
class.  We could do away with lambda expressions, because functor
classes have the same functionality.  Lambdas are just handy.

Since a closure is an object, it must have some type, but we usually
do not need it, and so we say that a closure is of an *anonymous
type*.  We can get the type of a closure with the `decltype` operator.

## Syntax

Lambda expressions can be nuanced, and we'll not cover all the
nuances.  However, most lambdas are of this syntax:

`[capture list](parameter list) mutable {body}`

The capture list and the parameter list are comma-separated.  If the
parameter list is empty, the `()` can be dropped.  Even if the capture
list and the body are empty, `[]` and `{}` cannot be dropped.

The capture list can have:

* a declarator of the default capture policy: either `=` or `&`, but
  not both, e.g., `[=]`, or `[&]`, but not `[&, =]`,

* captured variable names that can, but do not have to be, preceded by
  declarator `&`, e.g., `[&x]`,

* variable initializations `name-in-closure = variable-name` that can,
  but do not have to be, preceded by `&`, e.g., `[&x = y]`.

The parameter list is the list of function parameters, just like for a
regular function.

The `mutable` specifier is optional.  By default the member `()`
operator function is defined constant, but we can make it non-const
with the `mutable` specifier.

Therefore the simplest lambda is `[]{}`.  Here we create a closure and
call it in one go (in one expression):

```cpp
{% include_relative capture1.cc %}
```

Expression `[]{}()`, which creates and calls a closure, is equivalent
to this code:

```cpp
{% include_relative capture1a.cc %}
```

## Semantics

A lambda creates a functor type (a structure or a class), and an
object of this type.  These are the basic facts:

* The captured variables are stored as fields in the functor, and are
  initialized by the constructor.

* The parameter list becomes the parameter list of the member `()`
  operator function.

* The member `()` operator function is const unless `mutable` is
  specified.

* The body becomes the body of the member () operator function.  The
  return type of that function is deduced based on the expression of
  the return statement in the body.  If there is no return statement,
  the return type is `void`.

The capture list describes how to capture variables from the scope of
the lambda expression, so that they are available in the body.  The
scope is the fragment of code where variables are accessible, which
can be the global scope, the class scope, the function scope, and the
block scope.

The capture list can be empty.  In that case only the parameters of
the parameter list are available in the body.  Example:

```cpp
{% include_relative capture2.cc %}
```

The code above is equivalent to this code:

```cpp
{% include_relative capture2a.cc %}
```

## Ways of capturing variables

A variable can be captured by value or by reference.  When a variable
is captured by value, the closure keeps in its member field a copy of
the value of the captured variable, i.e., the member field was
initialized by copying the value of the captured variable.  To capture
a variable by value, put its name in the capture list.

When a variable is captured by reference, the closure keeps in its
member field a reference to the captured variable, i.e., the member
reference was initialized with the captured variable.  To capture a
variable by reference, put its name in the capture list, and preceeded
it by declarator `&`.

For example:

```cpp
{% include_relative capture3.cc %}
```

The code above is equivalent to this code:

```cpp
{% include_relative capture3a.cc %}
```

### Default capture policy

The capture list can begin with the default policy of capturing
variables either by value or by reference.  If a default capture
policy is given, *all variables* used in the body are captured, and we
do not have to list them.

We set the default capture-by-value policy with `=`.  For example:

```cpp
{% include_relative capture4.cc %}
```

The code above is equivalent to this code:

```cpp
{% include_relative capture4a.cc %}
```

We set the default capture-by-reference policy with `&`.  Please note
that in the example below, and the next example too, the call operator
can be const, because we are not modifying a member reference, but a
variable to which the member reference is bound.  Here's an example:

```cpp
{% include_relative capture5.cc %}
```

The code above is equivalent to this code:

```cpp
{% include_relative capture5a.cc %}
```

We can specify the default capture policy, and then list those
variables that should be captured the other way.  Also, for the member
fields, we do not have to use the names of the captured variables, but
we can give any name.

```cpp
{% include_relative capture6.cc %}
```

## Closure Examples

Since a closure has some type, but we just don't care about it, we
write:

`auto c = lambda expression;`

By using the `auto` type, we let the compiler deduce (this process is
called *type deduction*) the type of `c` based on the type of the
closure expression.  Even though there is the `=` sign, the line above
is not an *assignment expression*, but an *initialization statement*.
That entails that the closure is not copied, but created directly in
the memory location of `c` with copy elision.

Here's an example of using a lambda with a priority queue:

```cpp
{% include_relative pq_lambda1.cc %}
```

Here we pass an argument to a closure:

```cpp
{% include_relative pq_lambda2.cc %}
```

# Conclusion

* A callable is a generalization of a function.  A function and a
functor are callables.

* Unlike a function, a functor can store data.

* Lambdas are nifty and succinct: we can create closures with little
writing, and with less room for mistakes (lambdas are less
error-prone).

# Quiz
