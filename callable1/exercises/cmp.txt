There is given a structure `student` with fields `m_year` of type
`int` and `m_name` of type `string`.  Please write a lambda expression
to compare two objects of type `student`: `a` and `b`.  The lambda
captures a boolean value, on which the result of the comparison
depends: if the captured value is:

* `false`, then compare fields `m_year`: `a.m_year < b.m_year`,

* `true`, then compare fields `m_name`: `a.m_name < b.m_name`.

Next, please implement the same functionality using a functor
structure.
