Implement a non-template function `foo` that takes its argument by
value and declares its parameter as const-qualified.  Implement
function template `too` that does the same as `foo`.  In the main
function, call those functions, and then (with `nm`) look at the
symbol table of the executable.  Can you see the const qualifier?
